## Usage
This application is for the digital characters of Wreck-it Ralph. Mainly due to the word play with "Tech-it Ralph. 

Here we have a tech blog about the goings on with our favourite characters on a post/comment type forum.

Existing users can login in with their credentials and add posts, edit and delete their old posts. Users can also comment on their own or other posts.

New users can sign up with a user name and password. 

This application demonstrates an understanding of a MVC approach. 

First image shows an example of the most recent posts. The current signed in user and where they can log out or comment on other posts.

The 2nd image shows the code particularly the handlebars and server code.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions


Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
